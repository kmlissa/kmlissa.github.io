            My name is Katimu Lissa, I am a senior currently majoring in computer science. I was born in Charlotte, North Carolina
            but I am originally from Sierra Leone. In high school my academic focus was on engineering and once i entered
            university i started taking some computer engineering courses. Then one semester I took a computer science course
            where we were taught about C++ and it opened the pathway for my enjoyment of computer science.
